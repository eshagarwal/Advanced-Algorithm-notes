    "#### (a) Explain the In-Order traversal of a BST. Provide an algorithmic approach and also discuss an algorithm in which if we have the in-order list and you are asked to create the corresponding tree.\n",

    "(Ans:)  \n",
    "1. In-order traversal is a depth-first traversal method for binary trees, including binary search trees (BSTs). It visits the nodes in the following order:\n",
    "- Left Subtree: Recursively traverse the left subtree.\n",
    "- Root Node: Visit the root node.\n",
    "- Right Subtree: Recursively traverse the right subtree.\n",

    "## Question 5\n",
    "#### (a) Give an example of a real-world situation where a stack works better as a model than a queue. Why is a stack preferable to a queue in this situation?\n",
    "(A stack is a better model for trying to match parenthesis in an expression than a queue. The parenthesis that needs to be matched is always kept at the top of the stack. However, the first parenthesis in a queue is the only one that is stored there, therefore it cannot be used for matching.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Ans:) \n",
    "A stack is more appropriate than a queue when the order of operations is based on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "1. The undo operation in a text editor\n",
    "- Every time you make a change, this change is added to the stack of operations <br>\n",
    "If you want to undo a change, you need to revert the most recent operation, which is the last one added to the stack. \n",
    "- Therefore, a stack is the most appropriate data structure for this scenario.\n",
    "2. The back button on a web browser \n",
    "- When a user visits a new web page, the current page gets pushed onto the stack. When the user clicks the back button, the last page pushed onto the stack is popped off of the stack and loaded in the browser window. When all of the pages are popped off of the stack, the back button grays out, indicating that the stack is empty. \n",
    "- A queue wouldn't make sense here because: You want to go back to the most recently visited page and not the first page you visited in your browsing session\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (b) Describe a real-world situation where a queue works better as a model than a stack. Why is a queue superior to a stack in this situation?\n",
    "(Ans:) \n",
    "A queue is more appropriate than a stack when the order of operations is based on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "- When customers arrive at a shop/cafe/bank: <br>\n",
    "Each person joins the line at the end <br>\n",
    "The person at the front of the line gets served first <br>\n",
    "New customers continue joining at the back <br>\n",
    "Service follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle\n",
    "- A queue is superior to a stack here because: It's naturally fair - whoever arrives first gets served first\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (c) Give an example of a real-world situation where a fixed-sized array would be a better model than a linked list. Describe why an array is preferable to a linked list in this situation.\n",
    "(Ans:)\n",
    "A fixed-sized array is more appropriate than a linked list when the size of the data set is known and fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "- A calendar month view is an example where a fixed-sized array works better than a linked list.\n",
    "    - A month always has a fixed number of days (28-31 days)\n",
    "    - We know the exact size needed in advance\n",
    "    - Each array index represents a day of the month\n",
    "    - Quick access to any date is essential\n",
    "    - Since the size is fixed, we don't need the insertion/deletion flexibility of linked lists\n",
    "    - The predictable, unchanging nature of calendar months makes fixed-size arrays the perfect choice for this application, offering better performance and memory efficiency than a linked list would provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (d) Give an example of a real-world situation where a doubly linked list would be a better model than a binary search tree. Describe the advantages of a doubly linked list over a binary search tree in this situation.\n",
    "(Ans:)\n",
    "A music player's playlist is an example where a doubly linked list works better than a binary search tree. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigation Benefits:\n",
    "- Users frequently need to skip to next/previous songs\n",
    "- Doubly linked list allows instant forward/backward movement\n",
    "- Perfect for implementing previous/next track buttons\n",
    "2. Playlist Management:\n",
    "- Easy to add/remove songs anywhere in the playlist\n",
    "- Simple to reorder songs by adjusting a few pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary search tree would be less suitable because: \n",
    "- Songs don't need to be kept in sorted order\n",
    "- Tree rebalancing would be unnecessary overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "The doubly linked list's bidirectional nature perfectly matches how users interact with music playlists, making it the ideal data structure for this application."
